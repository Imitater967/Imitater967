# Welcome my friend.

 My name is Imitater967, or you can call me "The Disguiser".    
 Currently working at a moddable platform game with godot.    
 I don't have any associated or bachelor degree, I learn programming by coding minecraft plugins.  

# Ability

 C# is my best language, then java, I can do golang and dart as well but only writing logic, I HATE LUA.  
 I always use Unity, but I'm interacting with godot, because it's open-source.  
 I also can do Linux basics like install and depolying software, editing with vim.  
 Drawing, plainned to learn, but bad.  
 334554321123322 makes me happy, but `The Cannon` is my favorite.  
 Chinese is my mother tougue, I became a minecraft mod translator in english since 2014, learned some basic Russian. Now studying Japanese with duolingo  

# My goal

My goal is to create games that will educate people.
Gameplay aspect is always the most important,
Education Follows it, and organization of code is less important,
